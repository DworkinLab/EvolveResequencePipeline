# Discussion of pool seq papers to help us evaluate our own protocol

## March 31st 2017
[Kofler et al. 2016](http://www.g3journal.org/content/6/11/3507#sec-1). Suitability of different mapping algorithms
- no single one removed all artefacts.
- novalign and bwa mem did pretty well.
- Best to use two and use intersection of SNPs in VCF.
